# Brain-Stroke-Prediction
Analysis is done over the different medical conditions and lifestyle of people to get correct prediction.[readme-brain stroke.docx](https://github.com/SwatiNighut/Brain-Stroke-Prediction/files/6973217/readme-brain.stroke.docx)
•	Designed a web app that predicts the possibility of brain stroke .
•	The healthy lifestyle and other diseases play important role for brain stroke prediction. Develop the model which have good accuracy.
•	Deployed the Machine Learning model using streamlit library.
Data visualization
Done some visualization using seaborn and matplotlib to show interrelationship of features with each other and with target.
Data Preprocessing
There are a few columns which are categorical converted numeric with Label Encoder.
Handling the Imbalanced data with imblearn oversampling.
Model Building
Two model gave me good accuracy. LogisticRegression and Support vector classifier.
Hyperparameter tunning
Done Hyperparameter tunning for LogisticRegression with GridSearchCV.
Also done Hyperparameter tunning for Support vector classifier.
To increase the predictive accuracy apply some ensemble techniques.
Voting classifier, Gradient boosting,Xtreme gradient boosting.
Cross- validation
Cross validation applied to 2 models.
Model Deployment
I have deployed the model using Streamlit library.
